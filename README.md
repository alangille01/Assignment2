Hello! I'm Alexis and welcome to my personal portfolio! Here you can find information about me and my work experiences.

I worked very hard on my portfolio and added so many amazing features:

* Navigation links - click on the navigation bar above to go to any section
* Links to my projects - click on any screenshot to check out my deployed applications
 * My FitnessTracker App if my best work so far, and why I've highlighted it!
* A responsive layout that adapts to any screen size!
